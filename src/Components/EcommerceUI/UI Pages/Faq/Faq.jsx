          discounts on specific product categories, so it’s a good idea to check
          back often to take advantage of these savings. You can also find

          What steps does Arrc Technology take to ensure product authenticity?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Arrc Technology is committed to offering only genuine and authentic
          products to our customers. We work closely with our sellers to ensure
          that all items listed on our platform meet our strict quality and
          authenticity standards. Sellers are required to provide proof of
          authenticity for branded products, and we conduct regular audits to
          ensure compliance. Additionally, our customer review system allows
          shoppers to report any concerns about product authenticity. If a
          product is found to be counterfeit, we take immediate action,
          including removing the product from our platform and taking
          appropriate measures against the seller. Your trust is important to
          us, and we strive to create a marketplace where you can shop with
          confidence.
